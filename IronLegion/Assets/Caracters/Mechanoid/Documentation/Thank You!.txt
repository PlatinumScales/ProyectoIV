Hi!

If you are reading this then that means you are the proud new owner of my Sci Fi Mechanoid asset, congratulations! I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart, a lot of hard work has gone into creating this asset package, and it doesn't end here..!

Now you have purchased this package I will be continually available to you for support help, be it problems with the package OR general enquiries into implementation into different situations I am here to answer your questions to the best of my knowledge!

Please email me on elliottbutler3d@hotmail.com, or if you really feel inclined to (it's a bit weird speaking to strangers) then ring me on 07530696374. I am happy to help, but would rather you sent an email first ;)

Anyway now you have read this, please continue to read the 'Setup'.txt as there are a few edits to your local input manager that need doing before you can go around blowing things up :)

Thanks again,
ebutler3D
